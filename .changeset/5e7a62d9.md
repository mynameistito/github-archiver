Fix changelog header detection in GitHub Release body extraction

- Distinguish between level 2 headers (## ) and level 3 headers (### ) in changelog
- Prevent '### Patch Changes' from being mistaken as version header boundary
- Ensure full changeset content is extracted and displayed in release body
- Fixes empty release description issue caused by incorrect header matching
