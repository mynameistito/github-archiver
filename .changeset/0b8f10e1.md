Add explicit git tagging to release workflow and synchronize changelog

- Implement automatic version tag creation (v{version}) after successful npm publish
- Create and update 'latest' tag pointing to the most recent release
- Push both version and latest tags to remote for git history synchronization
- Ensure git tags are immediately available in the repository
- Update CHANGELOG with proper semantic versioning headers and GitHub compare links
- Improves consistency between git tags, npm releases, and GitHub releases
