Fix CHANGELOG parsing for GitHub Release body extraction

- Replace complex regex patterns with simple line-by-line parsing
- Handle all changelog header formats (with/without links, dates, brackets)
- Ensure release notes are properly populated in GitHub Release descriptions
- More reliable and maintainable changelog extraction logic
- Gracefully handles missing versions with fallback message
